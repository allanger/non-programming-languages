# What it's all about?

> I'm just learning, dude!
I am from Russia, so my first language is Russian. I was learning French and English in school, but my whole life, I was denying French completely.

After moving to Germany, I've realized that it's a pretty good idea to remember French and learn German (especially learn German, because it's a shame to live in a county without knowing the local language). But for some reason, I've decided to learn Spanish and Norwegian in addition to all languages above. 

So this is a little blog where I'm describing how I'm learning languages. I have some kind of a goal to speak these languages in 2 years, good enough to survive as a tourist in corresponding countries without speaking English.

Also, I will rate these languages, but please don't be insulted if your language has a bad rating here. In the end, doesn't mean anything, dude!

The main point for me is that it's so boring to learn something from scratch. So I will try to read the same book and understand it. 

The first book is "The Little Prince". While reading I will try to deconstruct everything and desribe it somehow.
