# **Unit 1:** Pronouns

## Intro

I've decided that the first unit should be __Pronouns__.
Actually, I think that the pronouns are a pretty complicated thing, but here I won't be trying to understand them deeply. 

These are tables with a little explanation for each pronoun in the "main" form.


## Pronouns tables
### English

| Pronoun  | Person        | Gender        | Plural/Singular | Notes     |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| **I**    | First person  | _Not Defined_ | Singular        | -         |
| **you**  | Second person | _Not Defined_ | Singular        | -         |
| **he**   | Third person  | Masculine     | Singular        | -         |
| **she**  | Third person  | Feminine      | Singular        | -         |
| **it**   | Third person  | _Not Defined_ | Singular        | Inanimate |
| **we**   | First person  | _Not Defined_ | Plural          | -         |
| **you**  | Second person | _Not Defined_ | Plural          | -         |
| **they** | Third person  | _Not Defined_ | Plural          | -         |

What I do love about English is that inanimate objects do not have a gender. It's makes a perfect sense since you don't have to remember what is being considered masculine or feminine.

### French 
| Pronoun   | Person        | Gender        | Plural/Singular | Notes                                         |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **je**    | First person  | _Not Defined_ | Singular        | -                                             |
| **tu**    | Second person | _Not Defined_ | Singular        | -                                             |
| **vous**  | Second person | _Not Defined_ | Singular        | Should be used when speaking with respect     |
| **il**    | Third person  | Masculine     | Singular        | -                                             |
| **elle**  | Third person  | Feminine      | Singular        | -                                             |
| **on**    | Third person  | _Not Defined_ | _Not Defined_   | This is almost like the word "one" in English |
| **nous**  | First person  | _Not Defined_ | Plural          | -                                             |
| **vous**  | Second person | _Not Defined_ | Plural          | -                                             |
| **ils**   | Third person  | Masculine     | Plural          | -                                             |
| **elles** | Third person  | Feminine      | Plural          | -                                             |

I think it's a bit screwed up in French, that you have to define a gender when using plural third person pronouns. 
But as I understand it, you must use "ils" if there is at least one male person in the group, to which you point with a pronouns.

### Spanish 
| Pronoun      | Person        | Gender        | Plural/Singular | Notes                                     |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **yo**       | First person  | _Not Defined_ | Singular        | -                                         |
| **tú**       | Second person | _Not Defined_ | Singular        | -                                         |
| **usted**    | Second person | _Not Defined_ | Singular        | Should be used when speaking with respect |
| **él**       | Third person  | Masculine     | Singular        | -                                         |
| **ella**     | Third person  | Feminine      | Singular        | -                                         |
| **nosotros** | First person  | Masculine     | Plural          | -                                         |
| **nosotras** | First person  | Feminine      | Plural          | -                                         |
| **vosotros** | Second person | Masculine     | Plural          | -                                         |
| **vosotras** | Second person | Feminine      | Plural          | -                                         |
| **ustedes**  | Second person | _Not Defined_ | Plural          | Should be used when speaking with respect |
| **ellos**    | Third person  | Masculine     | Plural          | -                                         |
| **ellas**    | Third person  | Feminine      | Plural          | -                                         |

If it's a bit screwed up in French, in Spanish it's even more complicated. But the logic is the same as in French for "ils" and "elles"
Use the feminine if there are no masculine people in the group.

### Norwegian
| Pronoun  | Person        | Gender        | Plural/Singular | Notes     |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| **jeg**  | First person  | _Not Defined_ | Singular        | -         |
| **du**   | Second person | _Not Defined_ | Singular        | -         |
| **han**  | Third person  | Masculine     | Singular        | -         |
| **hun**  | Third person  | Feminine      | Singular        | -         |
| **den**  | Third person  | Not neutral   | Singular        | Inanimate |
| **det**  | Third person  | Neutral       | Singular        | Inanimate |
| **vi**   | First person  | _Not Defined_ | Plural          | -         |
| **dere** | Second person | _Not Defined_ | Plural          | -         |
| **de**   | Third person  | _Not Defined_ | Plural          | -         |

The only thing I find strange here is _"det/den"_. Again, why to have gender for inanimate object

### Russian
| Pronoun | Person        | Gender        | Plural/Singular | Notes |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----- |
| **я**   | First person  | _Not Defined_ | Singular        | -     |
| **ты**  | Second person | _Not Defined_ | Singular        | -     |
| **он**  | Third person  | Masculine     | Singular        | -     |
| **она** | Third person  | Feminine      | Singular        | -     |
| **оно** | Third person  | Neutral       | Singular        | -     |
| **мы**  | First person  | _Not Defined_ | Plural          | -     |
| **вы**  | Second person | _Not Defined_ | Plural          | -     |
| **они** | Third person  | _Not Defined_ | Plural          | -     |

I really love the way English works. Other languages seem illogical to me. But I consider Spanish as the worst one, because of the gender thing in all plural pronouns. Then German and French. French because of the same thing as Spanish. And German for the "Sie" pronoun. Russian and Norwegian are pretty much the same here. It is a very little topic so I don't have a lot of things to say.
