# Nouns

## Intro

I believe that on the unit part, nouns are the most important port of speech. They are being used to describe an object in some kind of very direct way. Here I won't be trying to learn new words, but will try to understand which characteristics nouns has in my list of languages. And create a little table to compare them.

This is gonna be more about rules now. I find these characteristic sufficient at this step:
  - Grammatical gender
  - Grammatical case
  - Grammatical number

So in this topic I will just try to understand how these 4 things are working.

## Let's go

### English

#### Grammatical gender

This is the part that I love in English. English doesn't have there kind of genders other languages have. I was talking about it in the previous unit. 
The system is very simple. Only animate nouns can have gender and you will actually face genders when using pronouns, because genders here don't affect anything at all. 

So to understand this part, it's enough to have 3 nouns: girl, boy and pencil.
I will write an example for each of there nouns. Each example also will have a verb, an adjective and a pronoun
```
This is a pencil. It is blunt.
This is a boy. He is blunt.
This is a girl. She is blunt.
```

Easy as a pie. As I haven't written anything about verbs and adjectives yet, I will just say that they ain't changing, no matter what the gender of the noun is. The pronouns are easy too. If the object is inanimate, you should use "it", otherwise you should use "he" or "she" depending on what gender can be considered as corresponding to the noun. Tough sentence, but I'm just trying to be polite here.

#### Grammatical case

As I understand it, in the modern English there is no grammatical case. Something that is similar to case is the _-`s_ suffix. It is being used when an object belong to subject.
```
A boy has a pencil. It's a boy's pencil.
```

That's it. Easy again. And make a perfect sense to me.
#### Grammatical number
